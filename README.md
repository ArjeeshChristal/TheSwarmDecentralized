# TheSwarmDecentralized
This repository is started on June 24, 2025 and is expected to use python to deploy swarm drones on pixhawk based micro controllers and is aimed in a decentralized system. As of now we've decided to get started with the celular data to tranfer the data with the drones but in future if you notice some change, it means, something went wrong.
